The official number of our course this year is **S6-713-17-1**.

[Bryan on
Scouting](http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2014/04/08/ask-the-expert-wood-badge-course-numbering-decoded/)
has a great article that explains all this in detail, but the number
breaks down like this:

* **S6**. This identifies the BSA region and area that our council is
  in. **S** is for the Southern Region, and **6** is for Area 6. [Here's a map](http://www.scouting.org/filestore/designdevelop/pdf/SR_maps/S_Area_6_March2016.pdf)
  of Area 6.
* **713**. This is the council number for Sequoyah Council. Every
  council has its own number.
* **17**. This is the last two digits of the year, 2017.
* **1**. The final number is the Wood Badge course session within the
  council and year. Large councils will have several courses each year.
  We generally have one course every two years.

Since the _S6-_ prefix is a little redundant and the _-1_ suffix doesn't
change for us, we ususally just shorten the course number to the middle
portion, **713-17**. This is what you'll see on most course materials.

This numbering scheme was first used in Seqoyah Council on course
S6-713-11-1. Prior to that, courses were just numbered within a region.
The last course to use this numbering format was SR-990 in 2009.
